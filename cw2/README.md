# Dockerized Microservices Architecture

1. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Ensure Docker Compose is installed:
     ```bash
     docker-compose --version
     ```
   - Create a project directory for the exercise:
     ```bash
     mkdir docker_microservices
     cd docker_microservices
     ```

2. **Create Docker Compose YAML File:**
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project directory:
     ```bash
     touch docker-compose.yml
     ```
   - Define services for each microservice in the YAML file, including their dependencies, ports, and volumes.

3. **Develop Microservices:**
   - Create directories for each microservice and develop their respective Dockerfiles and application code.
   - Ensure each microservice communicates with others as necessary, simulating a real microservices architecture.

4. **Define Docker Compose Services:**
   - Define services for each microservice in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Specify container names, build contexts, ports, environment variables, and volumes.
   - Configure networks to enable communication between microservices.

5. **Build and Run the Application:**
   - Use Docker Compose to build and run the application:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build -d
     ```
   - Verify that all services are running without errors:
     ```bash
     docker-compose ps
     ```

6. **Test the Application:**
   - Test the functionality of the application by sending requests to the exposed endpoints of each microservice.
   - Ensure that data is being exchanged between microservices correctly.

7. **Scale Services (Optional):**
   - Demonstrate scaling of services using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose scale <service_name>=<number_of_instances>
     ```
   - Show how this affects the overall performance and scalability of the application.

8. **Volume Mounting and Persistent Data Storage:**
   - Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to include volume mounts for persistent data storage.
   - Illustrate how data persists even after containers are stopped and restarted.

9.  **Cleanup:**
    - Stop and remove all containers created by Docker Compose:
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```

**Conclusion:**
Conclude the exercise by summarizing the key learnings, including Docker Compose, multi-container applications, networking, volume mounting, and persistent data storage. Encourage students to explore more advanced Docker features and architectures. Provide additional resources for further learning, such as Docker documentation and tutorials.
